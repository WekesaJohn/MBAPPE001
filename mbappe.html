<p style="color: darkgreen;text-align: justify"> <i>is a set of computer programs and associated documentation and data.[1] This is in contrast to hardware, from which the system is built and which actually performs the work.

At the lowest programming level, executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU). Machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the user. The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to "jump" to a different instruction, or is interrupted by the operating system. As of 2023, most personal computers, smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together, so computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past.

The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages. They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to natural languages than machine languages.[2] High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler or an interpreter or a combination of the two. Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language, which has a strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an assembler.

<p style="color: darkgreen;text-align: justify"><B>An algorithm for what would have been the first piece of software was written by Ada Lovelace in the 19th century, for the planned Analytical Engine.[3] She created proofs to show how the engine would calculate Bernoulli numbers.[3] Because of the proofs and the algorithm, she is considered the first computer programmer.[4][5]

The first theory about software, prior to the creation of computers as we know them today, was proposed by Alan Turing in his 1936 essay, On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem).[6] This eventually led to the creation of the academic fields of computer science and software engineering; both fields study software and its creation.[citation needed] Computer science is the theoretical study of computer and software (Turing's essay is an example of computer science), whereas software engineering is the application of engineering principles to development of software.[7]

In 2000, Fred Shapiro, a librarian at the Yale Law School, published a letter revealing that John Wilder Tukey's 1958 paper "The Teaching of Concrete Mathematics"[8][9] contained the earliest known usage of the term "software" found in a search of JSTOR's electronic archives, predating the Oxford English Dictionary's citation by two years.[10] This led many to credit Tukey with coining the term, particularly in obituaries published that same year,[11] although Tukey never claimed credit for any such coinage. In 1995, Paul Niquette claimed he had originally coined the term in October 1953, although he could not find any documents supporting his claim.[12] The earliest known publication of the term "software" in an engineering context was in August 1953 by Richard R. Carhart, in a Rand Corporation Research Memorandum.[13]

<p><U STYLE="font-size: 60PX;background: brown;color: blue">Chelsea FC: 20 Best Players of All Time</U>
<h1><b>Greg Probert</b></h1>

   <p>Since Chelsea Football Club was founded in 1905, a number of talented players have worn the famous blue jersey.

    Pure talent alone is not enough to be called a "great," there are other factors that add to this prestigious title.

    This list was difficult to compile, and I am sure there are others some of you would wish to include.</p>

<h1><b>Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink</b></h1>

<img src="images/ji.webp" alt="">
1 of 21

   <p> Everyone at Chelsea loved Jimmy.

    And why wouldn't they? He averaged almost a goal every two games during his time at Chelsea.

    The Dutch striker is one of the most clinical finishers the Premier League has ever seen.

    Hasselbaink joined in 2000 and stayed for four years, in which time he made himself a fan favourite and is considered a Chelsea legend.
</p>
<h1><b>Graeme Le Saux</b></h1>
<!----ls--->
<img src="images/gl.jpeg" alt="">
2 of 21

    <p>Le Saux didn't have the easiest Chelsea career; in fact, it was one which had injury problems and controversy.

    But when he was playing, Le Saux was a class defender and an important part of the Chelsea defence.

    During his two spells with the side, he made over 250 appearances and helped Chelsea to glory in various trophies.
</p>
<h1><b>Ray Wilkins</b></h1>
<img src="images/rw.jpeg" alt="">
3 of 21

    <p>"Butch," as he is affectionately known, started his career at Chelsea.

    He stayed at the club for six years, making almost 200 performances and scoring over 30 goals.

    As well as being an important midfielder for the Blues, he also had a spell as assistant manager, and he was well liked by all Chelsea fans.

    We all love it when Ray Wilkins is commentating on a Chelsea game.
</p>
<h1><b>Petr Cech</b></h1>
<!---PC--->
<img src="images/pc.jpeg" alt="">
4 of 21

 <p>   When Chelsea bought Petr Cech in 2004 for £7 million, few people thought he could ever surpass Carlo Cudicini.

    But they were to be proved wrong.

    Cech has cemented his place in the Chelsea goal, and he has proved to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world over the last eight years.

    When Cech was involved in an on-field clash and received a horrific injury, it looked as if his career may be over.

    But no, Cech came back and reclaimed his place as Chelsea No.1, and he is continuing to impress to this day.
</p>
<h1><b>Alan Hudson</b></h><br>


    <img src="images/ah.jpeg" alt="">
5 of 21

 <p>   This skillful and flamboyant player made 145 appearances for Chelsea in the '60s and '70s.

    Rejected by Fulham when he was a boy, Chelsea snapped him up, and I bet they are glad they did.

    Hudson lit up the league and gained admirers with his classy way of playing.

    During his six-year stay at the club, he made himself a fan favourite.
</p>
<h1><b>Steve Clarke</b></h1>
<img src="images/sc.jpeg" alt="">
6 of 21

  <p>  Steve Clarke was a no-nonsense defender who was an important part of Chelsea's setup during the '90s.

    He was popular with the fans, and they voted him the Supporters Player of the Year in 1994.

    Clarke was reliable all the way through his career, making 330 appearances.
</p>
<h1><b>Ashley Cole</b></h1>
<!---Ashley Cole--->
<img src="images/ac.jpeg" alt="">
7 of 21

<p>    Now in his sixth year at Chelsea, he is still one of the first names on the team sheet in every game.

    Widely considered to be the best left-back in the world, Cole has been very important in Chelsea's recent rise to power.

    His solid defensive skills and marauding forward runs have made him popular amongst the Chelsea faithful.
</p>
<h1><b>Jimmy Greaves</b></h1>
<img src="images/jg.jpeg" alt="">
8 of 21

   <p> The player Chelsea should never have sold.

    By far the most prolific striker in the club's history, he scored 132 times in 169 games for the Blues.

    Greaves started his career at Chelsea and spent four years there, and although he is not most famous for being a Chelsea player, his place is well deserved on this list, as he is a Chelsea great.
   <br></p>
<h1><b>Marcel Desailly</b></h1>

<img src="images/md.jpeg" alt="">
9 of 21

  <p>  At £4.6 million, Desailly was the bargain of all bargains.

    The big Frenchman was captain of the side and boss of the Chelsea defence for six years.<br>

    Making 156 appearances for the Blues from 1998 through to 2004, his partnership at centre-back with Frank Lebouef was one of the most solid defences Chelsea have ever had.
</p>
<h1 style="color: blue;background: yellow"><b>Didier Drogba</b></h1>
<!.... this is Drogba photo....>
<img src="images/dd.jpeg" alt=""width="400" >
10 of 21

  <p>  Now in his eighth year at the club, Drogba has been a linchpin in Chelsea's side for many seasons.<br>

    Without his 150 goals, Chelsea may not have had the success they have had in recent years.

    His first season left Chelsea fans thinking the £24 million the club had spent on him was a waste, but since then, he has won over the crowd and most of them will be very sad the day Drogba leaves Stamford Bridge.
</p>
<p>Didier Yves Drogba Tébily (French pronunciation: ​[didje dʁɔɡba]; born 11 March 1978) is an Ivorian retired professional footballer who played as a striker.[5] He is the all-time top scorer and former captain of the Ivory Coast national team. He is best known for his career at Chelsea, for whom he has scored more goals than any other foreign player and is currently the club's fourth highest goal scorer of all time. Drogba was named Chelsea's greatest ever player in a poll of 20,000 fans conducted by Chelsea FC Magazine in 2012, and he was also named in the Chelsea team of the 2010–2020 decade by Chelsea's fans in 2020.[6][7] He is regarded as one of the greatest African players of all time and was noted for his physical strength, speed, ability in the air, powerful and accurate strikes, and ball retention. Drogba was named African Footballer of the Year twice, winning the award in 2006 and 2009. He is also the player with the most runner-up appearances (4), most third-place finishes (3), and most times in the top three (9).<br>

After playing in youth teams, Drogba made his professional debut aged 18 for Ligue 2 club Le Mans, and signed his first professional contract aged 21. After finishing the 2002–03 season with 17 goals in 34 appearances for Ligue 1 side Guingamp, he moved to Olympique de Marseille, where he finished as the third highest scorer in the 2003–04 season with 19 goals and helped the club reach the 2004 UEFA Cup Final.

In July 2004, Drogba moved to Premier League club Chelsea for a club record £24 million fee, making him the most expensive Ivorian player in history.<br> In his debut season he helped the club win their first league title in 50 years, and a year later he won another Premier League title. His displays saw him named in the FIFA World XI for 2007. In March 2012, he became the first African player to score 100 Premier League goals.<br>[8] Just two months later, he scored in Chelsea's 2012 FA Cup Final win over Liverpool to become the first (and as of 2017, the only) player to score in four separate FA Cup finals.[9] He also played in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final, in which he scored an 88th-minute equaliser and the winning penalty in the deciding shoot-out against Bayern Munich.[10] After spending 6 months with Shanghai Shenhua in China, and one and a half seasons with Turkish club Galatasaray where he scored the winning goal in the final of the 2013 Turkish Super Cup, Drogba returned to Chelsea in July 2014.[11][12] With a career record of scoring 10 goals in 10 finals winning 10 trophies at club level, Drogba has been referred to as the "ultimate big game player".<br>He joined Canadian club Montreal Impact in 2015 as a Designated Player and played 41 matches over two seasons, scoring 23 goals. Drogba became a player–owner for Phoenix Rising of the United Soccer League in 2017, and retired a year later at the age of 40. On April 21, 2022, he was inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame.

An Ivory Coast international between 2002 and 2014, Drogba captained the national team from 2006 until his retirement from the Ivory Coast team and is the nation's all-time top goalscorer with 65 goals from 105 appearances.[1][17] He led the Ivory Coast to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, their first appearance in the tournament, and also scored their first goal.<br> He later captained the Ivory Coast at the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups.[18] He was part of the Ivory Coast teams that reached the final of the Africa Cup of Nations in 2006 and 2012, but were beaten on penalties on both occasions. On 8 August 2014, he announced his retirement from international football.In 2018, Drogba retired from professional football at the age of 40.

Active in social issues in Africa, Drogba played a vital role in the peace process in his home country.[20] In 2007 he was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme, and in December 2018 he became Vice President of the international organization Peace and Sport.[21] </p>
<h1><b>Claude Makalele</b></h1>
<img src="images/km.jpeg" alt="">
11 of 21

  <p>  Signed from Real Madrid for £16.8 million in 2003, Claude Makalele is one of the best midfielders ever to wear a Chelsea shirt.

    He was classed as a defensive midfielder, but in reality, he was the engine that kept the team running smoothly.

    In his five-year stay, he showed his vision, skill, passion and energy to help Chelsea begin the most successful period of their history.

    All players that have tried to fill his position have been under immense pressure because nobody can do it like Claude.
</p>
<h1><b>Bobby Tambling</b></h1>
<img src="images/bt.jpeg" alt="">
12 of 21

  <p>  One word often used to describe this striker was prolific.

    Over an 11-year stay at Stamford Bridge, he managed to score 202 goals in 360 appearances.

    His goalscoring was one of the main reasons Chelsea were promoted back to the First Division in 1963, so thanks, Bobby, your place is well deserved.
</p>
<h1><b>Dennis Wise</b></h1>
    <img src="images/do.jpeg" alt="">
13 of 21

  <p>  The hardest man under 5'7", Dennis Wise was a tenacious player.

    Joining Chelsea in 1990, he had an 11-year stay at Stamford Bridge.

    Wise made 445 appearances and scored 76 goals in this time, quite an impressive goal return for a midfielder.

    He was famous for his leadership as Chelsea captain, his fierce tackles and who could forgot "that goal" against AC Milan.
</p>
<h1><b>Kerry Dixon</b></h1>
    <div class="kd">
    <img src="images/kd.jpeg" alt="">
14 of 21

   <p> By far Chelsea's main goal threat throughout the 1980s, Kerry Dixon enjoyed an impressive time at Stamford Bridge.

    Joining in 1983 for £150,000, Dixon scored 193 goals in his eight-year Chelsea career.

    He is still one of the fans' favourite characters, and he's greeted with a standing ovation every time he returns to the club.

    He is still involved with the club to this day and is a pundit on many television channels (and gives the Blues a well-deserved bias).
</p></div>
<h1><b>Peter Bonetti</b></h1>

    <img src="images/pb.jpeg" alt="">
15 of 21

 <p>   Peter "The Cat" Bonetti was a keeper years ahead of his time.

    One of the first keepers to use over and underarm throws to dispense the ball, he was a great talent.

    After joining in 1960, he stayed at Chelsea for 15 years, making almost 500 appearances

    He loved the Blues so much he came back for a second spell in 1976 and played a further 105 games.</p>

<h1><b>Ron Harris</b></h1>
    <img src="images/ro.jpeg" alt="">
16 of 21

  <p>  His nickname says it all...Chopper was one tough defender.

    A Chelsea legend, Chopper's career in a blue shirt spanned an amazing 19 years.

    It is no surprise that he is still to do this day the player to have made the most appearances for Chelsea, with a staggering 655 games.

    His loyalty and presence alone makes him a guarantee for this list.</p>

<h1><b>John Terry</b></h1>
<!---john terry--->
<img src="images/jt.jpeg" alt="">
17 of 21

  <p>  Already a Chelsea legend, there was no way John Terry was going to be kept off of this list.

    "Mr. Chelsea," as he is commonly known, has been at the Club since 1995.

    In his first season as first-team regular, he was voted Player of the Year, and it was only three more years until he was made Captain.

    He has remained the captain and heart of the team until this day, and he shows no signs of stopping. He even had a game as goalkeeper in 2006 and kept a clean sheet...what a player.
</p>
<h1><b>Peter Osgood</b></h1>
    <img src="images/po.jpeg" alt="">
18 of 21

  <p>  Named by fans as "The Wizard of Os" and "The King of Stamford Bridge," Peter Osgood is still, to this day, one of the most popular Chelsea players of all time.

    The 6'1" striker scored 150 times in 380 games in a Blue shirt, keeping his place as one of Chelsea's top scorers to this day.

    When "Ossie" died in 2006, the club and fans showed how much they admired him by building a statue of him near the West stand of Stamford Bridge.</p>

<h1><b>Gianfranco Zola</b></h1>

<img src="images/GZ.jpeg" alt="">
19 of 21

  <p>  I'm sure (many people's choice as No. 1 on this list) there are not enough superlatives in the dictionary to describe this man.

    Such an amazing talent, and at £4.5 million, he was an unbelievable bargain.

    During his seven years at Chelsea, he showed some outrageous skill, most notably the amazing back-heeled goal against Norwich City in 2002.

    He played for Chelsea 312 times and scored an impressive 80 goals. There is only one Gianfranco Zola.</p>

<h1><b>Frank Lampard</b></h1>
<!---frank lampard--->
<img src="images/fl.jpeg" alt="">
20 of 21

  <p>  Lampard is a phenomenon who is Chelsea's third all-time goalscorer...and he's a midfielder.

    When he signed for the Blues in 2001 for £11 million, the fans knew he was something special, but they had no idea how special.

    Over his long Chelsea career, he has managed to find the net 181 times, and adding that to his assists and defence-splitting runs, he has been vital in Chelsea winning three Premier League titles.

    With his career coming to an end, you might think Lampard would have lost his touch.

    No chance. Frank has already scored 11 goals in all competitions this season, and it's only January.

    "Lamps" has been a revelation for Chelsea, and he thoroughly deserves the top spot.</p>

    <h1><b>Honourable Mentions</b></h1>

  <p>  There are a number of players that just missed out on the top 20. All great talents and loved at Chelsea, they deserve a mention.</p>

  <h1 style="color: blue;background: yellow">  <b>Michael Essien</b></h1>
    <div class="me">
<!--- Essien--->
        <img src="images/me.jpeg" alt="" width="1000px" height="144px">
<p>Michael Kojo Essien (born 3 December 1982) is a Ghanaian former professional footballer who played as a midfielder and is currently a member of Danish Superliga club Nordsjælland's coaching staff. He was also capped for the Ghana national team more than 50 times. During his prime,<br> Essien was considered one of the best midfielders in the world.<br>

Essien started his career playing for Liberty Professionals in Ghana. In 2000, he moved to France to join Bastia,<br>where he would spend three seasons and appear in over 60 matches before joining Ligue 1 title holders Lyon in 2003.<br> At Lyon, Essien won back-to-back league titles in 2003–04 and 2004–05, and won Ligue 1 Player of the Year in 2005.<br>  During his five-year stint in France, he acquired French citizenship. <br> In 2005, Essien signed with Premier League side Chelsea for a £24.4 million transfer fee and, at the time of his signing, was the most expensive African footballer in history.<br>  At Chelsea, Essien helped the club win the Premier League in 2006 and 2010, as well as three FA Cups and one League Cup. <br> He won the UEFA Champions League in 2011–12,while also placing as runner-up in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League.<br>  He has won the Chelsea Goal of the Season award twice, in the 2006–07 and 2008–09 seasons.<br>

Essien is a former Ghanaian international. At youth level, he represented his country at the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship and 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship,<br>  with the latter team finishing as runner-up. Essien made his senior team debut in January 2002 and has represented his nation at three Africa Cup of Nations tournaments. Essien has also represented Ghana at the 2006 and 2014 FIFA World Cups.
</p>
<p>On 14 August 2005, Lyon and Chelsea agreed a £24.4 million fee for Essien, ending one of the longest-running transfer sagas.[27] At the time, the fee made Essien Chelsea's most expensive signing of all time, surpassing the £24 million Chelsea paid for Didier Drogba the previous summer. The transfer went through on 19 August.[28] The transfer came under scrutiny in the Stevens inquiry report, which expressed concerns because of the lack of co-operation from agents Pini Zahavi and Barry Silkman.[29][30]

Essien made his debut as a second-half substitute against Arsenal on 21 August 2005, wearing the number 5 on his shirt. The match ended in a 1–0 victory to Chelsea.[31] He made an assist in his full debut against West Bromwich Albion, and he replaced the injured Claude Makélélé in the defensive midfield role against Sunderland in the 2–0 win on 10 September 2005. He soon cemented his place in José Mourinho's side, starting in 31 domestic league matches, as well as 11 appearances in other cup competitions.

On 15 December 2005, Essien was handed a two-match ban by UEFA for a controversial tackle on Dietmar Hamann, which resulted in his suspension from Chelsea's Champions League second round tie with eventual European champions Barcelona.[32] Essien apologised to Hamann for the challenge, stating that while he desires to be perceived as a player who "unsettles" opponents, he was not a malicious or an unsporting player; Hamann publicly accepted Essien's apology. In January 2006, Essien was himself stretchered off the field after a challenge from West Ham United captain Nigel Reo-Coker, and was sidelined for three weeks.

Essien scored his first goal for Chelsea from a low cross from Shaun Wright-Phillips on 11 March 2006, in a 2–1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur.[33] His second goal came on 17 April 2006, against Everton with a powerful strike after an assertive burst through the defensive line. Essien ended his maiden season in England with two goals, both in the Premier League.

Essien was nominated for the 2006 FIFA World Player of the Year Award on 12 October 2006, where he placed 22nd. One week later, he was nominated for the 2006 Ballon d'Or. He was voted as the third Best African Footballer of the Year in 2006,[34] a feat he also achieved in 2005.[35] He won the 2006 BBC African footballer of the year award.[36]

The following season, Essien scored several important goals, including his first Champions League goal for Chelsea in a 2–0 victory over Werder Bremen on 12 September 2006. Later in the competition, Essien scored a late winner in the quarter-final second leg against Valencia at the Mestalla Stadium to send Chelsea through to the semifinals with a 2–1 victory on the night and a 3–2 win on aggregate.[37] It was his first match back in the team after several weeks out with a knee injury. Essien also scored a stunning late equaliser at home against Arsenal on 10 December 2006, as the match was going to end Chelsea's long unbeaten run.[38]

On 15 May 2007, Chelsea fans voted Essien as Chelsea Player of the Year for his contributions in the 2006–07 season,[39] becoming the first African to receive the honour. His late dramatic equalising goal against Arsenal was also voted as Chelsea Goal of the Season for 2006–07.

On 12 August 2007, Essien scored the winner with his first goal of the 2007–08 Premier League campaign, as Chelsea defeated Birmingham City to set an English record for unbeaten league matches at home, eclipsing Liverpool's previous top-flight record of 63 sets between 1978 and 1981.[40]

On 10 October 2007, Essien was nominated[41] for the prestigious 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year Award for the third consecutive year and on 21 October 2007, he was also nominated for the 2007 Ballon d'Or Award for the third consecutive year. He was voted 15th Best Player in the World at the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year Awards. On 12 December 2007, he was nominated for the 2007 African Footballer of the Year, the third consecutive time he had been nominated.[42] He was runner-up to that year's winner, Frédéric Kanouté.

On 22 July 2008, Essien signed a new five-year deal with Chelsea, keeping him at the club until 2013.[43] He also extended his contract on 12 March 2007.[44]
Essien in action for Chelsea in 2010

It was feared Essien would miss the 2008–09 Premier League season after sustaining anterior cruciate ligament damage on 5 September while playing for Ghana. However, on 7 March 2009, he came on as a substitute in the second half of the FA Cup match against Coventry City. In his second match back from the knee injury, Essien scored just before half-time to give Chelsea a vital away goal against Juventus in the Champions League first knockout round. Chelsea went on the draw the match 2–2 and through to the quarter-finals 3–2 on aggregate.[45] He made his first league start from injury against Manchester City, scoring the only goal in the match.

On 6 May 2009, Essien scored a stunning left-footed volley in the second leg of the Champions League semifinal against Barcelona, a tie that Chelsea ultimately lost due to the away goal rule.[46] The goal was later voted as Chelsea's Goal of the Season by the club's fans.

In the 2009–10 Premier League season, Essien put in an excellent performance against Blackburn Rovers on 24 October 2009 and scored his first goal of the season with a swerving 35-yard shot on 52 minutes in a 5–0 victory at Stamford Bridge. He scored his first brace for Chelsea against Wolverhampton Wanderers with a header and a low shot from outside the box and came close to completing his first hat-trick for the club with a flurry of second-half shots, one of which was tipped onto the bar by Wolves goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey. Essien was injured on international duty during the 2010 African Nations Cup and missed the remainder of the English domestic season. On 4 June 2010, he signed a two-year extension to his existing contract which would have kept him at the club until 2015.[47] Essien returned to action on 17 July 2010 in a friendly against Crystal Palace and scored the only goal of the match to give Chelsea the win.

After missing the 2010 FIFA World Cup through injury, Essien had a bright start to the season for Chelsea. He scored the only goal in a pre-season friendly win against Crystal Palace and was an ever-present in Chelsea's unbeaten month of August. He scored a brace against West Ham United, and he scored against MŠK Žilina in the UEFA Champions League. Essien also put in impressive performances against Marseille, Blackburn Rovers and Fulham, the latter a match in which he scored the only goal and received a red card. However, Essien would again incur an injury and missed two months of the season, during which Chelsea won just one out of nine matches. He returned to score in the penalty shoot-out loss in the FA Cup against Everton but ultimately had a poor second half of the season. After Chelsea's final match, the Ghana Football Association announced Essien had returned to the international squad.

In pre-season training for the 2011–12 Premier League season, Essien ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus, undergoing surgery on 11 July 2011. His recovery was said to take up to six months.[48] However, he began training lightly in late November 2011 and made his comeback on 9 January 2012, playing 75 minutes of the reserves' 3–2 defeat to West Bromwich Albion.[49] He made his 150th Premier League appearance for Chelsea as a substitute in a 1–0 win over Sunderland.[50][51] On 21 January 2012, Essien featured as late substitute in Chelsea's 0–0 draw with Norwich City at Carrow Road.

Due to missing most of the beginning half of the 2011–12 Premier League season, Essien was unable to gain favour with manager André Villas-Boas. On 21 February 2012, during a Champions League match against Napoli, Villas-Boas left Frank Lampard, Essien and Ashley Cole on the substitutes' bench. Chelsea lost 3–1 and the club's technical director asked for an explanation of the team selection on behalf of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich.[52] On 4 March 2012, following a 1–0 league defeat against West Brom which left Chelsea three points adrift of Arsenal in the battle for fourth place in the Premier League, Villas-Boas' employment was terminated by Chelsea, with assistant manager Roberto Di Matteo being appointed as caretaker manager on an interim basis until the end of the season. Di Matteo immediately showed favour towards veteran Chelsea players like Essien, Lampard and John Terry. Subsequently, Essien started in Chelsea's second leg champions league fixture against Napoli, with Chelsea winning 4–1 – and 5–4 on aggregate – in an entertaining match allowing Chelsea to advance to the quarter-final, where they met Benfica. Essien subsequently remained an unused substitute in Chelsea's Champions League run, culminating in the Blues' victory over Bayern Munich in the final, making Chelsea the first London-based club to win the title.
